##Task 1:
Create a database named global_analysis with two tables:
• gdp_2020
• covid_19
Include appropriate data types and constraints (primary keys, NOT NULL where appropriate,
CHECK constraints for percentages).

##Task 2:
Write commands to import data from CSV files gdp_2020.csv and covid_19.csv into their
respective tables. Handle potential import errors.

##Task 3:
